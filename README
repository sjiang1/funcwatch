Usage instructions:
./funcwatch <program name> <function name>
The included test program has a function called foo that gets run 4 times. Foo has a parameter called i. For each run you will see the name, size and value of each parameter, in this case just i.
To run funcwatch on test do the following:
./funcwatch test foo
Note that size and value are not working yet.


## UPDATE on Dec. 1, 2015
You can now also pass arguments to the target program. 
funcwatch <function> <program> [args...]

e.g.
funcwatch foo test a b c d
